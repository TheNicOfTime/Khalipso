# General Information

Dula, on the outskirts of the traversable systems of the [[Khalipso Sector]], exists as a tech center for the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. With a population nearing 60 million, it is one of the fastest growing systems in the sector as the Federation continually increases it's spending on cutting edge tech in order to stay ahead of [[The Poleus Bloc]]. Several large military industrial firms are headquartered here, with some of the largest contracts for weapons development the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] government has given out. 
This development is fairly recent, within the last 20-30 decades. The Federation was attracted to this for their ability to tightly control travel to and from this location, and it's relative remove from the rest of the sector. 
The planet is not rich in minerals, however there are large swathes of livable land. 

## History
60 years ago, with the dawn of the age of Math Drive travel, the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] happened upon this planet and discovered a [[Tech Levels|TL2]] level human society on a northern island of around 400-500 thousand. These humans were organized as a single imperial government, but were stuck on their island in the north of the planet due to ocean beasts large enough to destroy any vessel TL3 or below. The first exploratory mission to the planet landed on this island, however went missing shortly afterwards. The [[Kenneth MacAlpin|Emperor]] of the island insists that the ship never landed, however logs kept by the Federation indicate the island is the last location of the ship.
