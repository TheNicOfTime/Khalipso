# General Information

Dula, on the outskirts of the traversable systems of the [[Khalipso Sector]], exists as a tech center for the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. With a population nearing 60 million, it is one of the fastest growing systems in the sector as the Federation continually increases it's spending on cutting edge tech in order to stay ahead of [[The Poleus Bloc]]. Several large military industrial firms are headquartered here, with some of the largest contracts for weapons development the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] government has given out. 
This development is fairly recent, within the last 20-30 decades. The Federation was attracted to this for their ability to tightly control travel to and from this location, and it's relative remove from the rest of the sector. 
The planet is not rich in minerals, however there are large swathes of livable land. 

## History
60 years ago, with the dawn of the age of Math Drive travel, the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] happened upon this planet and discovered a [[Tech Levels|TL2]] level human society on a northern island of around 400-500 thousand. These humans were organized as a single imperial government, but were stuck on their island in the north of the planet due to ocean beasts large enough to destroy any vessel TL3 or below. The first exploratory mission to the planet landed on this island, however went missing shortly afterwards. The [[Kenneth MacAlpin|Emperor]] of the island insists that the ship never landed, however logs kept by the Federation indicate the island is the last location of the ship. 

## Geography

One large archipelago in the north where the [[Empire of Ingin]], and two large continents to the south. 

### Iona

Southwestern continent, where majority of population centers of the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] are. The world's major spaceport is located near the most populous city, [[Falkirk]]. Only spaceport that allows civilian incoming and outgoing travel. 

### Dunkeld

Southeastern continent, humongous shipyards, miltech compounds and research bases are located. A superspeed rail network connects most of the continent to the port city of Airdrie on [[Dula#Iona|Iona]]. Miltech zaibatsu's control the entirety of the continent, and are constantly vying for more power and funding from the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]. Many spaceports, but exclusively for government/corporate shipping. 

### Inchmurrin

Large island that exists as the only major landmass in the northern hemisphere. Home to the [[Empire of Ingin]], land is even lower in mineral resources than the rest of the world hence the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] has reached an agreement with the MacAlpin dynasty to not travel to the island and let the civilization remain cutoff from the rest of the galaxy. The [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]] has erected massive holo projectors around the island to hide the spaceship travel to and from the planet from the local populace.

### The Cailleach

Name for the ocean that covers a large amount of the planet, taken from the local populace. Extremely dangerous to traverse without [[Tech Levels|TL3+]] sonar disrupters attached to the vessel, as the ocean is infested with massive sea monsters that can consume most ships, including high tech vessels. Sonar disrupters discourage approach of these monsters, allowing travel. The [[Empire of Ingin]] has been stuck on [[Dula#Inchmurrin|Inchmurrin]] for centuries due to this.
