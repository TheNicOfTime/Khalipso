# Intro

Something unknown to the sector has appeared in the skies above [[Dula]], and you don't intend to stay to find out what. Trapped on a world tightly controlled by the [[The Federation of United Planets|Federation]]'s Miltech Bureau, you suddenly find yourself in a desperate search for a way off of a doomed world. 

## Session info


Goal is to have this complete in 1 pretty long session, and then move back into a formula similar to when we first started. My plan for this session is to make it challenging enough for it to be a 50/50 chance for the characters in this to survive, so you shouldnâ€™t feel compelled to put too much effort into the backstory.

# Character creation guidelines

For this session, characters will be level 5. 

Your character should have a reason for being on [[Dula]], but this can be whatever you want. Employee of one of the miltech conglomerates, from the local populace, or just visiting for some reason. Other than that, characters can be whatever you want.
