# Start of session

## Opening Narration

You all disembark [[The Last Resort]] after a surprisingly successful mission to unillegalize yourselves in the eyes of the Federation to a slightly busier [[Terminus]] than what you left. You notice a couple more shops have opened up on the station, and some non-[[Tiandi]] mercenaries pass by you in the narrow hallways of the gas-giant bound station. There is even a trade ship from a corporation you recognize as not completely a front for a criminal organization docked next to your ship. It seems as if you have already had an effect on the standing of a place a few of you might even have some warm feelings about now.

Everyone has arrived safely back on [[Terminus]] after clearing their names.
