# Initial Combat

They are being attacked by members of [[Eberswalde]]. They want to capture [[Boomerang]] and the others because the "Unmistakeable Stench Of Failure" is a flagged ship in their system, as it is the last known ship of eccentric billionaire archeologist playboy [[Grundle Deetrix]]. They want him because he has a lot of knowledge about ancient [[Terran Mandate]] tech, and he apparently got deeper into the [[Svallga#Sanctum Bundesarchiv|Archives]] than anyone and came back. They want him to take them to some ancient knowledge in the Archives, knowledge about how to build spike drives that can drill much closer to gravity wells, which will allow getting past a system's defense fleet and attack planets. They will try to knock out the players and take them.

The [[Frenchies]] will also be there. One of them will pop up out of a grate in a back alley and try to get some of the players to come with them down into the sewers. 

I will try to encourage the rest of them to run away.
